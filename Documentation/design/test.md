# Testing and feedback 

After I believed that my portfolio was suitable enough to get feedback, I did a test demonstration with my tutor Ashley Oliver. After going through my portfolio, he had two main points in the portfolio that I also believed that I should improve upon. 

## 1st improvement 

The first piece of feedback that I received was that I should 'proofread' my portfolio. We understood why this slight issue may have occurred which is because Microsoft sways autocorrect feature will not use autocorrect if the spelling is correct, but even if it is wrong in the context, it would still see it as correct. This will be a simple fix just with some proofreading and correcting the grammar. It is important to proofread my portfolio since the point of your portfolio is to showcase your ability and skills, having spelling mistakes and poor grammar will not impress the audience, especially potential employers.  

## 2nd improvement 

The second piece of feedback that I received was Ashley recommending that I 'sharpen the statements about what the evidence on my portfolio proves'. I need to make more statements on the information about the evidence that would be more relevant and interesting to employers. Yet again this will be a simple fix just by me rewording some of the text where this is the case. I totally agreed with this feedback since I am aware that a portfolio must include the most relevant information possible to set apart my application from other people that are applying for the same job. 

# Second feedback 

After I received feedback from Ashley, I then decided to get feedback from one of the other students in my class. The student that gave me feedback was Patryk Milasevski. After going through the portfolio with him he also had two main improvements that he had in mind.  

## 1st improvement  

The first piece of feedback that I received from Patryk was for me to 'write about MOS (Microsoft Office Specialist)'. Including information about my exams on the Microsoft Office Specialist exams I believe can prove quite useful in gaining the attention of potential IT employers since the Microsoft software such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel are commonly used in IT workplaces, so it would be ideal to highlight the fact that I have some experience and knowledge of them. 

## 2nd improvement 

The second piece of feedback that I received from Patryk is that he said I should include 'what you want to do in future'. Personally, I disagree that I should include this because I personally do not believe that it is relevant for gaining the attention of an IT job employer. My portfolio is used more for displaying my skills and past achievements instead of sharing my intentions.  

# Refined content and reasoning

These are the features of my portfolio that I have changed after receiving the feedback from Ashley and the other students. 

## 1st refined content

Firstly, after recieving the feedback from Ashley, I agreed to make some changes to my statements which are used to explain what my assets prove and how they are relevant for being employed in an IT job. I agreed to make this change because I knew how making my statemnts as sharp as possible is important in trying to convince employers how the past achievements I am talking about are relevant and how they will help to be successful in an IT workplace.

## 2nd refined content

After the feedback from Ashley where he made me aware of the grammar errors, I just simply did some proofreading through my portfolio to make sure that I haven't made any more grammar errors whilst correcting the ones that Ashley pointed out. I agreed that it is important to make this change to my portfolio because having poor grammar will be terrible at convincing employers that I put in effort since because it shows that I haven't done any proofreading. Having great grammar however, can convince employers that I have put in the effort into my portfolio and that I clearly care about getting employed. 

# Review 

After making my digital portfolio I must say that I am quite satisfied with the final design, I believe that it meets the target audience requirements since it has a large variety of relevant information and reasonable statements for why they are relevant. I believe my navigation is successful in achieving the purpose of meeting the audiences needs because it is simple and starightfoward, this can convince employers that I like to keep my work organised because it saves them the time of having to try and navigate through a complex navigation system. My chosen color scheme I believe is very IT related, it is a commonly used color scheme in the online world.  

## This design and the original 

The final design does have a few changes to the original design, but you can see the comparison because the layout is still similar. This is because most of the changes that I have made to my portfolio are not the sort of changes that will make a huge change to the layout, they were more minor changes such as grammar and making my statements much sharper. The biggest difference between the final design and the original is the addition of the video that I added. Ashely's feedback on my grammar was extremely useful since I will need perfect grammar because the portfolio's purpose is to display my ability and having poor grammar is not going to help display that, my final design obviously has corrected grammar which is another reason it gives it the edge over the original. 

## Changes made

Eventually, after the testing the protfolio for the first time, I decided to make a change to my portfolio which I thought was a great idea. I added a video onto the 'My hobbies' section of me at my karate dojo. The main purpose of this video is to add a bit of variety into my portfolio, like Lisa mentioned to me in my storyboard feedback, stuff like this highlights that I have put some thought into my portfolio which is the sort of thing that convinces employers that I am interested in getting an IT related job. Here is a screenshot of the video that I have added to my digital portfolio.

After all of the feedback that I recieved there was a featutre I did add which was my idea. I eventually added some explanation about my MOS exams and also a screenshot of some of my scores as evidence and three images of the Word, PowerPoint and Excel logos which are just for design. 

Here are two screenshots, one being the added MOS exam explanation and one being the added images of my MOS exam results and the Microsoft software logos. 
I chose to add this because it is relevant information for employers since these pieces of software are common in IT workplaces and displaying my knowledge of them on my portfolio can really help in convincing employers that I am worth the attention.

## Future improvements 

If I had to make any improvements to my portfolio, I would probably add new features such as audio, mainly to add some variety in my portfolio, it could be anything like someones positive comment on me as a person or feedback on work that I have doen etc. I could probably add an improved video of the one that is already on my digital portfolio, this is because it isn't that long and the quality of the video could be much better, but even though the current video has these disadvantages, it does achieve the purpose of being used as proof that I actually did karate.
