# Testing and feedback

After I believed that my portfolio was suitable enough to get feedback I did a test demonstration with my tutor Ashley Oliver. After going through my portfolio he had two main points in the portfolio that I also believed that I should improve upon.

## 1st improvement

The first piece of feedback that I received was that I should 'proofread' my portfolio. We understood why this slight issue may have occured which is because microsoft sways autocorrect feature will not use atuocorrect if the spelling is correct, but even if it is wrong in the context it would still see it as correct. This will be an simple fix just with some proofreading and correcting the grammar. It is important to proofread my portfolio since the point of your portfolio is to showcase your ability and skills, having spelling mistakes and poor grammar will not impress the audience, especially potential employers. 

## 2nd improvement

The second piece of feedback that I received was Ashley recommending that I 'sharpen the statements about what the evidence on my portfolio proves'. I need to make more statements on the information about the evidence that would be more relevant and interesting to employers. Yet again this will be a simple fix just by me rewording some of the text where this is the case. I totally agreed with this feedback since I am aware that a portfolio must include the most relevant information possible in order to set apart my application from other people that are applying for the same job.

# Second feedback

After I recieved feedback from Ashley I then decided to get feedbcak from one of the other students in my class. The student that gave me feedback was Patryk Milasevski. After going through the portfolio with him he also had two main improvemnets that he had in mind. 

## 1st improvement 

The first piece of feedback that I recieved from Patryk was for me to 'write about MOS'. Including information about my exams on the Microsoft Office Specialist isn't really important at this time since I haven't finished all of them yet. If I had finished all of them however, I would definitely include this on my portfolio.

## 2nd improvement

The second piece of feedback that I recieved form Patryk is that he said I should include 'what you want to do in future'. Personally, I disagree that I should include this because I personally don't believe that it is relevant for gaining the attention of an IT job employer. My portfolio is used more for showcasing my skills and past achievements instead of sharing my intentions. 

# What I changed

These are the features of my portfolio that I have changed after receiving the feedback. 

## 1st change

The first thing that I changed was the statements on my portfolio. Like Ashley mentioned I made them more sharp, I imporved the explanation for why the images on the portfolio are relevant. I just did some more proofreading after this change to make sure that all of my grammar was correct. 

## 2nd change 

After the feedback about some of the grammar, I just simply reworded all of the grammar errors that Ashley pointed out whilst testing the digital portfolio. Whilst proofreading throughout the entire portfolio, I didn't find any more spelling or grammar errors.

## 3rd change

# Review

After making my digital portfolio I must say that I am quite satisfied with the final design, I believe that it meets the target audience requirements since it has a large variety of relevant information and reasonable statements for why they are relevant. My navigation is very straightfoward since no employer wants to spend most of their time struggling to navigate through a complex navigation system. My chosen colour scheme I believe is very IT related, it is a commonly used colour scheme used 

## This design and the original

The final design does have a few changes to the original design but you can definately see the comparison because the layout is still pretty similar. This is because most of the changes that I have made to my portfolio aren't the sort of changes that will make a huge change on the layout, they were more minor changes such as grammar and making my statements much sharper. The biggest difference between the final design and the original is the addition of the video that I added. Ashelys feedback on my grammar was very useful since I will need perfect grammar because the portfolios purpose is to showcase my ability and having poor grammar isn't going to help showcase that, my final design obviously has correctd grammar which is another reason why it gives it the edge over the original. 

## Future improvemnets

If I had to make any improvemnets to my portfolio I would add some information about MOS if I am able to finish the last exam I have which is on Excel. If I had the chance I would add other assets in the form of different contents such as videos, audio, programs or systems, this is to just add a bit of variety into my portfolio and to simply make it more appealing towards potential IT employers.
