# Navigation

## Evaluation 

Since I am going to be making this digital portfolio on microsoft sway the navigation will be much more simple than something like a website since a sway presentation is simply just a scroll down. However, there will be different sections of this portfolio so I will be showing the order that they go in.

## Navigation description 

In summary,the naviagtion is going to be a scroll down which I chose since there are other options to have it go left or right on microsoft sway. All of these sections are all connected obviously because it is a Sway presentation and all of them can be seen just by scrolling up and down. In the image, this is the order they are going to be in, there will be specific layouts applied to each of these sections that will be explained in the storyboard documentation. 

## Why this naviagtion

The reason I chose Sway and to have this navigation is because a portfolio is used to showcase your achievements, skill and personality and this simple navigation makes showcasing these key points much easier since having this simple navigation can allow me to have a much more professional and appealing layout. The people who would want to view this portfolio won't have to deal with a complex navigation system awhen all they have to do is just scroll down and easily find what they're looking for.
