# Portfolio colour scheme

This is the colour scheme that I will be using for my digital portfolio.

## Colour uses

I will be using the white as the background of the whole portfolio and as the text colour for the headers becaus blue will be used as the background for the headers so white is a great colour to have as the text colour when it is mixing with a blue background. The black will be used as the text colour whenever there is a white background behind the text so that the text is visible. 

I believe the colours that I have chosen are very suitable because they mix together well especially when it comes to the text because it is easily readable and they aren't colours that make it difficlut to read and it indicates that I have acknowledged that people may have difficulties in reading the text when it is a certain colour. The blue and white I also think is rather fitting for this portfolio because it is a common colour scheme used online in the online world for websites or software e.g. Visual Studio Code, Adobe Photoshop and Word etc.

The only instance where there may be other colours included on the digital portfolio is when there are images or videos because they may contain their own colours which isn't a big deal because most of them will be contained in their own box to prevent them form taking up most of the space.

# Alternative colour scheme

This was another colour scheme idea that I had in mind but I ended up using the other one.

## Reasons I didn't choose this

The main reason I didn't choose this colour scheme is because it is less related to IT than the other colour scheme. Eventhough I agree that this colour scheme looks organised and neat and the colours mix well, it looks more like a colour scheme that would be used in a portfolio for someone that wants a job that is related to something like geography since the green and grey theme may represent something like plants or climates etc. That's why I chose the other colour scheme, it is a colour scheme that is commonly used in websites and anything else within the online world.
