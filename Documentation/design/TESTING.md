# Testing and feedback

After I believed that my portfolio was suitable enough to get feedback I did a test demonstration with my tutor Ashley Oliver. After going through my portfolio he had two main points in the portfolio that I also believed that I should improve upon.

## 1st improvment

The first piece of feedback that I recieved was that there was just some proofreading that needed to be done. We understood why this slight issue may have occured which is because microsoft sways autocorrect feature will not use atuocorrect if the spelling is correct, but even if it is wrong in the context it would still see it as correct. This will be an simple fix just with some proofreading and correcting the grammar. It is important to proofread my portfolio since the point of your portfolio is to showcase your ability and skills, having spelling mistakes and poor grammar will not impress the audience, especially potential employers. 

## 2nd improvment

The second piece of feedback that I recieved was Ashley recommending that I sharpen the statements about what the evidence on my portfolio proves. I need to make more statements on the information about the evidence that would be more relevant and interesting to employers. Yet again this will be a simple fix just by me rewording some of the text where this is the case. I totally agreed with this feedback since I am aware that a portfolio must include the most relevant information possible in order to set apart my application from other people that are applying for the same job.
