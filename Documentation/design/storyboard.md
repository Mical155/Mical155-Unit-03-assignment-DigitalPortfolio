# Portfolio storyboards

## Title and about me section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/TitleStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This will be the layout for the start of the portfolio and it will contain the title, my name a section that is a description of me. I chose this layout because I believed that having a little personal profile at the start was a great idea since it introduces anyone who is viewing this portfolio to me who is the person that the portfolio is going to be based on. The conatiner that is holding the title and my name will have its own background just for decoration, it will be an image of the college of west anglia becuase it is apart of my educational experience. 

The title, my name and all of the headers will have blue backgrounds since it is one of the colours within my chosen colour scheme. The background for all of thye sections will be white because the colour for most of the text will be black, so it was ideal to have a bright background so that the black text was more visible, I did acknowledge that mixing certain colours together can make the text less vsisble and harder to read plus some people may have difficulties in reading certain coloured text so I just chose two colours that mix well which was black and white. 

The image will be an image of me for my personal profile and the about me description will be providing an introduction me, my name, what college I go to and some things I do in my free time etc. I will give the image a subtle emphasis which is the smallest size setting for images on microsoft sway, I chose this size because it prevents the image from being distorted whilst not being too small up to the point it is barely visible.

## My eductaion section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/MyEducationStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This section is an introduction of my education experience in three schools I went to and the next three sections will go into more detail. Since this an introduction there isn't much to this page. There is the header at the top which will have that blue background like all of the other headers within this portfolio. There is text underneath that which is the introduction of my educational experience and it identifies all three of the schools that I went to which is Cavalry Primary, Neale-Wade Academy and College of West Anglia. Then underneath that is a slide show of three images, each image is an establishing shot of the buildings of the three schools.

This layout for this section is appropriate because this section is only an introduction to three other sections which contain more detail. So in conclusion this section won't require a vast amount of features and components when it is only an introduction with a slide show. The colours scheme will be used the same way as it was used on the title section, the rest of the sections in the portfolio will have the colour scheme used the same way. 

I feel as if this layout is successful at meeting the audiences needs because it provides them with a simple introduction to three other sections that provide a detailed description on the three schools that I have been to. In summary, it gives them some context and identifies what is going to be explained to grab their attention into reading the three next sections. 

## My college section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/MyCollegeStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This is one of the three sections that is apart of the 'My education' section. This section goes over some of my college experiences and it is one of the longer sections since it contains some of the work I completed in my computing course. It has two groups of text with one of them explaining my work on hardware management and one explaining my unit 13 which is the website development coursework. Each one has four images which are used as evidence to show that I have done these tasks and to prove that I have decent knowledege on these topics. 

I believe that this is a great layout for this section because contains all of this content into an organised and tidy layout which is crutial because the portfolio is mainly used to gain employers attention and having a professional layout is something that indicates that you put effort into it.

## Neale-Wade section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/Neale-WadeStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This section is the second of the three sections within the 'my education' section which explains my time in Neale-Wade Academy. The main attraction of this section is the topic of my GCSE results which is something that employers look for, so it is important to showcase them. Underneath the image of my GCSE results is an explanation for why media studies was my favourite chosen subject, this will give context to employers of what type of subjects interest me and how they ineterest me. 

The reason this is my chosen layout for this section is because the image is at an appropriate size because it makes the results on it much more easily readable. This storyboard will meet the audiences needs because I am providing them with a clear showcase of important information such as my final GCSE grades in Neale-Wade.

## Cavalry Primary section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/CavalryPrimaryStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This section is the third of the three sections within the 'My Education' section. This section goes over my experience in Cavalry Primary and this layout is relatively small mainly because it is one of the sections with the least amount of content in this digital portfolio. It only contains an explanation with an image beside it used as evidence which will have a the small size setting because the actual image itself is quite small. Underneath that, there is further explanation that goes over my favourite subject in that school and that is IT. Like the other sections in the portfolio, the colours within my chosen colour scheme will be used the exact same way in this section. 

I chose this layout because it is a simple layout for a simple topic which makes it easier to find certain information that may be relevant to employers or organisations etc. The fact that I am stating that IT was my favourite subject in Primary school may catch the attention IT employers because it indicates that I am interested with the subject.

## My Hobbies section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/MyHobbiesStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This is another small section because there is simply not much to explain about the two main topics in this section. I will make sure to include details that will interest the audience and explain why the these two hobbies are relevant and worthy to pay attention to. The colour scheme is used te same way as the other pages in this portfolio. 

I believe that this layout will successfully meet the audiences needs because it is very easy to navigate through which makes it simple to find information that they may find interesting or important, plus the evidence on the right hand side highlights that these are actually my hobbies.

## My Skills section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/MySkillsStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This section has a similar layout to the previous section mainly because of the same reason, the both of them don't have much to explain about but I made sure to include the important information that will most likely catch the attention of potential employers. Like the other sections, the colours within the colour scheme will be used the same way. There is just an explanation of my skills and why they are relevant and how they are my main skills. I also provided the link to my CV so that the audience can view it to gain extra information on my skills which can be valuable information to employers. 

What makes this layout able to meet the audiences needs is the fact that it is easy to find the importnat information in this section since it is a very simple layout that is very simple to navigate through. The fact that I have also provided a link to the Word document of my CV will allow any employer to view extra information that may be worth paying attention to. 

## Work experience section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/WorkExperienceStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This storyboard is the layout of the 'Work Experience' section on my digital portfolio. The first half  of this layout is very similar to the last two storyboards
but the difference being that the image is on the left side and the information is the right side, the description will include a link to Blue Chips website. The image will be the logo of Blue Chip Brand Solutions which is the 3D digital printing company I did my 60 hours of work experience at, the image will be given the small size setting. Underneath that is an image with the largest size setting containing a screenshot of my logged work experience hours which will be used as proof that I have done my 60 hours, underneath that image is just further information of my experience at Blue Chip Brand Solutions. 

I believe that this layout meets the audiences needs because the image of the logo and the description next to it is a great way to give the audience some context onto my work experience because not only am I providing information on what they do, I am also proviiding their logo and website link so that the audience will know exactly what the company does and that will indicate waht skills I must've learned there. 

# Alternative storyboards

These are some alternative ideas that I had when it came to making the storyboards for my digital portfolio, I obviously ended up choosing the other designs for the portfolio. Some of the storyboards may not have an alternatives because I didn't have any other possible ideal layouts for them meaning that the layout I chose for them already convinced me that they are the one that I will go with. 

## My education section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/AlternateMyEducationStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

In this alternate design the three images of the schools that I went to are not in a slide show but are in a group with one of the images being a moderate size and the other two being a rather small size. Another difference between this layout and the original is the introduction being underneath the three images instead of coming before them. The reasons I chose the other layout over this one is because the three images may not appear in decent quality when they have the subtle emphasis setting, having the two bottom images this small size might make them difficult to see since the images are meant to be moderately large, also having them all a moderate size in a slide show not only makes the content on them more visible but it also saves some space.

I believe that the original design having the introduction above the images is better because it contains an explanation for what the images are and what they mean and it just gives people an explanation of the content to come before they see it whereas in this version it explains the images purpose after. In conclusion, having the introduction above the images does a better job at identifying what they are meant for so that anyone will know their purpose for when they see the images. 

## My College section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/AlternateMyCollegeStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

In this alternate design for the 'My College' section the only differenes beteen this and the original storyboard is the images of my course work and practicals are in slide shows that are at a moderate size. I chose the original storyboard over thsi one because some of the images have a small width so having them on a moderate sized slide show which could make them look stretched out. Whereas, having them in organised layout will allow sway to place them in their own sizes making them easier to see. One example for one of the images that have a short width is the opening view of the mobile version of my website, since it is made to be compatible with a phone it will have a similar size to a phone which means it will have a short width.

## Work experience section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/AlternateWorkExperienceStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This alternate version of the 'Work Experience' section has the image of the Blue Chip logo at the largest size setting with the description being underneath instead of being on the right of the logo. The screenshot of my logged work hours are at the smallest size setting instead of being at the largest like the original design, the description is also on the left of the image instead of being placed underneath it. I ended up choosing the original storyboard over this one because it is mainly to do with the image sizes. The image of the Blue Chip logo is actually not meant to be a large image which means having it a this size will make the image have seem distorted. The logged hours image has the opposite problem, the screenshot is meant to be a large image due to its long width, so having this image compressed to a small size on this design will make the content on the image barely readable.
