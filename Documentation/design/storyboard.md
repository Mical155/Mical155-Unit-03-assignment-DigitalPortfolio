# Portfolio storyboards

## Title and about me section

<img src="../Img/storyboards/TitleStoryboard.jpg" alt="alt text" height="100%" width="100%">

This will be the layout for the start of the portfolio and it will contain the title, my name a section that is a description of me. I chose this layout because I believed that having a little personal profile at the start was a great idea since it introduces anyone who is viewing this portfolio to me who is the person that the portfolio is going to be based on. The conatiner that is holding the title and my name will have its own background just for decoration, it will be an image of the college of west anglia becuase it is apart of my educational experience. The title, my name and all of the headers will have blue backgrounds since it is one of the colours within my chosen colour scheme. The background for all of thye sections will be white because the colour for most of the text will be black, so it was ideal to have a bright background so that the black text was more visible, I did acknowledge that mixing certain colours together can make the text less vsisble and harder to read plus some people may have difficulties in reading certain coloured text so I just chose two colours that mix well which was black and white. 

The image will be an image of me for my personal profile and the about me description will be providing an introduction me, my name, what college I go to and some things I do in my free time etc. I will give the image a subtle emphasis which is the smallest size setting for images on microsoft sway, I chose this size because it prevents the image from being distorted whilst not being too small up to the point it is barely visible.

## My eductaion section

This section is an introduction of my education experience in three schools I went to and the next three sections will go into more detail. Since this an introduction there isn't much to this page. There is the header at the top which will have that blue background like all of the other headers within this portfolio. There is text underneath that which is the introduction of my educational experience and it identifies all three of the schools that I went to which is Cavalry Primary, Neale-Wade Academy and College of West Anglia. Then underneath that is a slide show of three images, each image is an establishing shot of the buildings of the three schools.

I though that this layout for this section is appropriate because this section is only an introduction to three other sections which contain more detail. So in conclusion this section won't require a vast amount of features and components when it is only an introduction with a slide show.

## My college section

This is one of the three sections that is apart of the 'My education' section. This section goes over some of my college experiences and it is one of the longer sections since it contains some of the work I completed in my computing course. It has two groups of text with one of them explaining my work on hardware management and one explaining my unit 13 which is the website development coursework. Each one has four images which are used as evidence to show that I have done these tasks and to prove that I have decent knowledege on these topics. I believed that this is a great layout for this section because contains all of this content into an organised and tidy layout which is crutial because the portfolio is mainly used to gain employers attention and having a professional layout is something that indicates that you put effort into it.

## Neale-Wade section

This section is the second of the three sections within the 'my education' section which explains my time in Neale-Wade Academy. The main attraction of this section is the topic of my GCSE results which is something that employers look for, so it is important to showcase them. Underneath the image of my GCSE results is an explanation for why media studies was my favourite chosen subject, this will give context to employers of what type of subjects interest me and how they ineterest me. The first reason this is my chosen layout for this section is because the image is at an appropriate size because it makes the results on it much more easily readable.
