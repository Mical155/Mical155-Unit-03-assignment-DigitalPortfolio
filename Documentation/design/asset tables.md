# Preparing assets 

Here is a group of tables which contains the assets that I will be using in my digital portfolio and the title of the table is the section that the assets will be going into.

## Title and about me sections

| https://students.cwa.ac.uk/learner/434879 | image of myself | N | 450 x 450 | Will be the only image on the 'about me' section |

I put the two assets in the 'Title' and 'about me' sections in the same asset table because there is one image on each section. The image in the 'Title' section is just used for design, being the background of the 'Title' section. The image in the 'about me' section will be next to the information about me, pretty much used as a little personal profile.

## My education (introduction) section

This is the introduction part of the 'My education' 
section. There are three images that will be conatined in a slide show next to the explanation of the three schools I have went to (College of West Anglia, Neale-Wade Academy and Cavalry Primary).

## My education (College) section

| file:///D:/L2_2022_U13_Mitchell%20-%20Copy/Src/HTML(Mobile)/Home.html | Mobile phone website opening view | N | 663 x 956 | Will be the first image in the explanation of my web development in the college section |
| file:///D:/L2_2022_U13_Mitchell%20-%20Copy/Src/HTML(Mobile)/Home.html | Youtube video on my website home page | N | 1920 x 1080 | Will be the second image in the explanation of my web development in the college section |

| file:///D:/L2_2022_U13_Mitchell%20-%20Copy/Src/HTML/Help.html | Help page of my phone shop website | N | 1920 x 1080 | Will be the fourth image in the explanation of my web development in the college section |

In this table, the first asset is actually four images, I only made them one asset on the table because they are the same image just with different angles and components from the PC I was taking apart. The rest of the assets are the images that will be next to explanation of the development of my website and they will be used as evidence that I have created the website. The image of the opening view for my website has a smaller size than the other images of the website because the opening view is a screenshot of the mobile version whereas the others are screenshots of the PC version.

## Neale-Wade and Cavalry Primary sections

| https://students.cwa.ac.uk/learner/434879  | GCSE results  | N  | 1019 x 488  | Will be the only image in the Neale-Wade section in the 'my education' section  |
|   | Sports day photo  |   |   | Will be the only image in the Cavalry Primary section in the 'my education' section  |

Like the first asset table, there is only one image on each of these sections so I just put them into one asset table. The GCSE results will be on the 'Neale-Wade' section; used as evidence that I got decent grades. The image on the 'Cavalry Primary' section is an image of me at sports day which will be used to convince people that I am willing to participate in activites and that I have confidence.

## My Hobbies section

|   | Me in my karate dojo  | N  | 450 x 450  | Will be the second image on the slide show in the 'My Hobbies' section  |

The 'My Hobbies' section will have two images conatined in a slide show. One of them is an image of the Hudson Leisure Centre which has the gym I go to, the other is an image of me at my karate dojo. These will be used to highlight the fact that I am dedicated and am willing to put effort into anything that I am working on.

## My skills section

There is only one image in this asset table, I decided not to convert this section with another to make one asset table because the link for the source of this asset is very long. The asset is an image of the opening view of my CV which contains a full explanation of my skills and why they are my main skills. There is also a link within the text for this section that will take you to the actual word document of my CV.

## Work experience section

| http://www.bluechipbs.co.uk/  | Blue Chip Brand Solutions logo  | Y  | 800 x 604  | Will be the first image on the 'work experience' section  | 
| https://students.cwa.ac.uk/learner/434879/experiences  | Logged hours of work experience  | N  | 1887 x 498  | Will be the second image on the 'work experience' section |

There is two images in this section and one of them is the logo of Blue Chip Brand Solutions which was the company that I did my wrok experience at, it's mainly used for design and context. The second image in this section is a screenshot of my logged hours which has been cropped to only contain the content that is relevant, this will be used as evidence to show that I have completed my 60 hours of work experience.

Most of the images do have random sizes but the main reason is becuase sway has a feature where it can resize the image to fit on the screen perfectly so it saved me time having to edit the size of the images on photoshop.
