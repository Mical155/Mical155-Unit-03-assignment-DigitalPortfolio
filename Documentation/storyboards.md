# Portfolio storyboards

These are the storyboards for each page of my digital portfolio. I will be explianing the contents within these pages and how I will be using the colours and the fonts.

# Evaluation

## Layout

For each page of this portfolio, I have made them all have a very similar layout becuase it will allow any viewer to feel familiar with the layout of each page and navigating through them. Whilst keeping the consistency for most of the layout, I have given each page a different layout to the large box in the middle containing the introduction to each topic. I did this becuase although keeping consistency, I felt that I should make at least some aspects of the pages different becuase it can feel a bit dull and boring having absolutely everything the exact same, I obviously kept the buttons for the navigation the same on each page becuase the are very important components for navigating through the portfolio. 

## Sub pages

The sub pages is the storyboard for each page that comes after the four main pages (Home, my education, out of school activities, my skills and work experience). Like the other pages, this page has the same layout for the navigation aspects but the layout within the large box in the center is different. This time large box will be a scroll down, I made it like this becuase the height of that box will be determined by how much content I place in there so I thought it would be safe for it to just automatically resize it's height for each piece of content I put in there. 

## Colours 

The colour scheme I have chosen I thought was very appealing and suitable for a digital portfolio. The main reasons I chose this is because it's not too colorful up to the point where it would look unprfessional on a portfolio but it is simple yet contains bright colours that mix together well. I made sure that the colours included in this chosen colour scheme are different types of colours because having the exact same type of colours would make the portfolio very dull.
