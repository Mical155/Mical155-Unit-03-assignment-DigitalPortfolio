## Why these are important to include

### description of myself:

A description of myself is a great way to introduce myself on the first page of my digital portfolio, it allows the reader of my portfolio to know who this portfolio is about and what I am like as a person, in this description I should include any information about me that would convince them that I am worth the attention e.g. education, great personality etc. I can also include an image of myself, obviously one where I look my best e.g. image for my college lanyard.

### showcase of past achievements:

In my portfolio I should be including a description of my past achievements as a way of highlighting that I'm dedicated, hard working etc. The achievements can be based on education such as my grades or past projects I have completed, they can even be based on anything outside of education. 

### showcase of my skill

Obviously, stakeholders like employers will be looking for your skills, so ideally I should include some information based on that. I should be clear about what subjects I am interested in and best at, I should also include what my weaknesses are so that employers are aware of them and know what to look out for.

### colorful/appealing color scheme

For my digital portfolio I should give it an appealing and creative design in order to catch the attention of whoever the portfolio is aimed. One way of doing this is to have a colorful color scheme for my portfolio which includes a variety of colors that mix well. This is done because stakeholders look for creativity and a colorful color scheme just simply makes you seem more interesting.

### information that is relevant 

Any information that I will provide the viewers of my portfoloio should at least be relevant. In other words it should based on a certain topic that will gain the interest of certain employers or anyone else viewing my digital portfolio.

### images/evidence

When I include information based on my achievements for example I should always be including some form of evidence. One way of doing this is by using still images. After including an image of one of my achievements I must explain why it is relevant and why it deserves attention. 

### videos

Just like the still images, the videos can be used for evidence which showcases my achievements and skills. Yet again I must explain why it is relevant and why it also deserves attenttion.

### functional components

What I mean by functional components is that everything in my portfolio must be fuctional. From the navigation to buttons everything must work properly in order to indicate that to employers and viewers that I now hat i'm doing, plus it shows that I care and I like to put in the effort.
